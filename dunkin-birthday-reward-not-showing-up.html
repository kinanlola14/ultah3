	<div class="navi text-center">
					<p>You just have to show up on friday, june 5, 2020, and ask for your free donut. However, they&#039;ve since changed their annual offer and it looks like they&#039;re rotating between the freebies. I&#039;m asking because this rule doesn&#039;t really make sense at all (it&#039;s not intuitive). <br>
